# Undergraduate Projects
Various Smaller Projects completed during my undergraduate degree at Queen's University.

This repository compiles samplings of previous works. Hobby projects will be added over time as the job hunt continues.

InsultGenerator was developed as a C++ assignment.

Multi_Modual_Image_Registration has been designed for Matlab though individual image files will be viewable with compatible software.
